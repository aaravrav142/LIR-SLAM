SLAM implementation in MATLab for a horizontal lidar.

The code works on Linux and MacOSX (I am unsure if the mex 
files will work as is on Windows).

To run the example:
  - Download one of the two log files:
      log 20 - https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~brindza/files/lir_slam_log20.tar.gz
      log 21 - https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~brindza/files/lir_slam_log21.tar.gz
  - Extract the log files into the data/ directory
  - Depending on which log you want to use set the CONFIG.lognum variable to 20 or 21 
  - open matlab from this directory
  - in matlab run:
      >> run_slam

To test just the kalman filter:
  - Download on the the log files:
      https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~brindza/files/lir_ukf_logs.tar.gz
  - Extract the log files to the data/ directory
  - Depending on which log you want to use set the CONFIG.lognum variable
  - open matlab from this directory
  - in matlab run:
    >> run_ukf

The config.m file contains all the configuration variables.
To enable merging the kinect data set the use_kinect flag to true.
